## üì¶ Folder Structure

```
weather-webapp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                      # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/styles.css           # Styling for the app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/scripts.js           # JavaScript for functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for the structure of the app.
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Logic for fetching and displaying weather data.
- **Weather API**: Integrated with [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for real-time data.

---

## üíª How It Works

1. Users enter the name of a city in the search bar.
2. The app fetches weather data for the city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
3. Displays the following information:
   - Current temperature
   - Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)
   - Humidity level
   - Wind speed
4. Includes responsive styling for optimal viewing on all devices.

# Fixing Asset Paths for Local Development

When working on a web project locally, you might encounter issues where images or fonts fail to load. This often happens because the asset paths in the code include a prefix specific to the production environment, such as `/cloud-scout`.

## Problem

In production, asset paths might look like this in your `.css` or `.js` files:

### Example
```css
background-image: url('/cloud-scout/assets/images/background.jpg');

```Font Family
src: url(/cloud-scout/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

These paths work in production but fail on a local system because the `/cloud-scout` prefix doesn't exist in the local environment.

## Solution

To fix this issue, **remove the `/cloud-scout` prefix** and use relative paths instead.

### Updated Code
```css
background-image: url('/assets/images/background.jpg');
```
```Font Family
src: url(/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```


## Benefits of Using Relative Paths
1. **Local Compatibility**: Assets will load correctly on your local system.
2. **Cross-Environment Consistency**: The project will work seamlessly in both local and production environments.
3. **Simpler Maintenance**: Relative paths are easier to manage during development and deployment.

## Implementation Steps
1. Open your `.css` or `.js` files.
2. Search for paths containing `/cloud-scout` (or any other production-specific prefix).
3. Replace these paths with relative paths starting from the project root or relevant directory.

### Before
```css
background-image: url('/cloud-scout/assets/images/background.jpg');
```
```Font Family
src: url(/cloud-scout/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

### After
```css
background-image: url('/assets/images/background.jpg');
```
```Font Family
src: url(/fonts/iosevkanerdfontmono.ttf) format("truetype");
```

By making these adjustments, your project will be ready for local development without breaking asset loading functionality.
```

This is structured for a clear and professional GitHub `README.md` file and uses Markdown conventions effectively.
